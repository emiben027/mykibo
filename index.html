								<h3>My Three Most Important Core values
								</h3>
								<p>
									Value is akin to worth, importance or usefulness. As humans, we all have values but one thing we all need to have is Core Values. Growing up, we pick one or more values on our way, as we become adult it changes and some values remain the same. Core values defines us and embodies our personality and projects who we really are to people and the world around us.
								<br>&nbsp<br>
									As a human navigating through life, I have worth which can be perceived by others around me, a few can be noticed instantly while others overtime. You don't have to wait overtime to know these values as I will tell you my three most important core values.
								<br>&nbsp<br>
									Achieving set goals is a challenge am always willing o take up and seeing it come to fulfillment is what makes me tick as a person. Discipline is my First core value, having a task or goal in hand and the resilient to always work towards it no matter the odd and seeing it through is what makes me who I am. As a student affected by industrial actions I have been able to focus on a learning path online and offline and sharpening my web developing skills.
								<br>&nbsp<br>
									Always asking the tough questions and getting answers has been my forte growing up. I have at a point in time provoked by primary school teacher with my eagerness to learn by asking too many questions, but for me there was no such thing as asking too much questions. Surface knowledge was and is never enough, I strive for in-depth knowledge, it's either "go big or go home" when it comes to knowing about an important subject matter. Curiosity is my second core value, it has propelled me to some heights in acquiring skills and knowledge. This core value guides me through the search for sources that will sharpen and shape my IT skills for the better.
								<br>&nbsp<br>
									I haven't created next Monalisa masterpiece, who said I can't? Well, not everyone is a painter, so paint pictures their voice and others just by saying or doing nothing, am not talking about Noble peace winners. Creativity is my third core value, I have the ability to be creative as it is a very big part of me and  form of expressing not only my personality y also my thoughts. Apart from web development, I have created countless business logos and designs and am focus to improve on that part of my creativity.
